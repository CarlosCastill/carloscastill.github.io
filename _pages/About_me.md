### Who I am...

My full name is Carlos Eduardo Castillo Garzon, I know it is quite long, but that is the way in my home country; Colombia. By the way, you can simply call me Carlos.

### My background...

I was born in Bogota, which is the capital and largest city from Colombia, where I lived for 28 years of my life. Back in 2011 I finished my Bachelors' degree in Industrial Engineering, which gave me the opportunity to be hired at IBM as an intern, company where I work for 5 years after graduated and where I adquired most of my relevant experience in different roles, such as, Data Analysis, Project Manager and Program Manager.

### Where I currently live...

I moved to Australia in 2014 with the idea to study english for one year, however, things went better than expected and here I am, I received my Australian permanent residency after 5 years living in this beatufil country. I am currently located in Melbourne, but I have also lived in Perth and Sydeny for a while.

### What I have done in Australia...

During this 5 years in Australia I decied to do a Master degree in Data Science in RMIT University, which I succesfully finished in 2018. This Master degree provided me with a huge set of tools to start my career in the data field, which I wish I can start soon.

### What I like...

Another dream accomplished in Australia was to buy my own motorcycle, which I did at the begining of 2020, just before the pandemic of COVID 19 started. My big aim is one day to travel all around Australia in my Yamaha Tener√©.
