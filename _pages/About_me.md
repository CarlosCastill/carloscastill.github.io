### Who I am...

My full name is Carlos Eduardo Castillo Garzon, I know it is quite long, but that is the way in my home country; Colombia. By the way, you can simply call me Carlos.

### My background...

I was born in Bogota, which is the capital and largest city from Colombia, where I lived for 28 years of my life. Back in 2011, I finished my Bachelors' degree in Industrial Engineering, which gave me the opportunity to be hired at IBM as an intern, company where I worked for 5 years after graduated and where I acquired most of my professional experience in different roles, such as, Data Analyst, Project Manager and Program Manager.

### Where I currently live...

I moved to Australia in 2014 with the idea to study English for one year, however, things went better than expected and here I am, I received my Australian permanent residency after 5 years living in this great country. I am currently located in Melbourne, but I have also lived in Perth and Sydney for a while.

### What I have done in Australia...

During these 5 years in Australia I decided to do a Master degree in Data Science at RMIT University, which I successfully finished in 2018. This Master degree provided me with a huge set of tools to start my career in the data field, which I wish I can start soon.

### What I like...

Another dream accomplished in Australia was to buy my own motorcycle, which I did at the beginning of 2020, just before the pandemic of COVID 19 started. My big aim is one day to travel all around Australia in my Yamaha Tener√©.

### What I will do in the short future...

My goal is re-start my professional career in Melbourne, in a role that allows me to develop my career and provide me with plenty of experience, aiming to take these learnings to create my own business.
In the meantime, I will continue to travel around the world any time I have the chance to.

And of course, I love watching and playing soccer.
